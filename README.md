Welcome to the Data Cleaning and Pre-processing repo! 

This repository is dedicated to preparing and analyzing datasets through data cleaning techniques(handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, detecting outliers, and feature engineering). 

My goal is to create and evaluate machine learning models on these cleaned datasets.

Thanks for visiting (:
